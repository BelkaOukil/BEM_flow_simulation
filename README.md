# BEM_potential_flow_simulaiton
Computational fluid mechanics : Potential flow around cylindric obstacle &amp; near uniform war using BEM 


The hypotheses of non viscous potential flow are applyed to the navier stokes equations (Euler equations), using the boundary elements methods, this code simulates the flow around a dimensionally stable cylindric obstacle that is near a uniform vertical wall. The system is free from any boundaries at the other directions. This code was the subject of a master 1 internship in fluid mechanics, and as a first brick of a big project, which is to simulate viscous flows around complexe non uniform obstacles, it is free to be continued.
